## Changes
### Monsters
* Many small changes to which monsters spawn in which areas.
* Removed all 'guest monsters' in Act IV except a few which I like.
* Council Members and Minions of Destruction are now regular monsters that spawn in certain areas of Acts III-V.

### Items
* Staves spawn with inherent bonuses to various skills, mainly summoning.
* A number of other item types can spawn with new skill bonuses (including circlets, bone helms and scythes).
* Improved rune drop drates.
* Better base items drop, but fewer items drop overall.

### Mercenaries
* Cold Iron Wolf now casts Glacial Spike, Frozen Orb and Decrepify.
* Fire Iron Wolf replaced by Penitent, which looks like a Doom Knight and casts Bone Spear and Amplify Damage.
* Lightning Iron Wolf replaced by Exorcist, which looks like a Cantor and casts Fist of the Heavens and Confuse.

### Incorporates the Basic QoL mod by Cyhyraethz:
* Increased stack size for keys, tomes, and quivers
* Additional spells can be cast in town (e.g. Teleport)
* Always get quest drops from Andariel (Quest Bug)
* New cube recipe for safe unsocket (TP Scroll + Item)
* New cube recipe for respec token (TP Scroll + ID Scroll)
* Item levels are displayed next to item names
* Standard of Heroes can be sold to spawn dclone
* Gheed sells herbs that can be sold to spawn dclone

## Known bugs
The monster mercenaries sometimes get stuck and freeze in place for a minute or more. They usually recover on their own, but it takes time. A Town Portal might help. I have not found out what causes this.
